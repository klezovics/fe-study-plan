# Project generators
- https://pankod.github.io/superplate/ -> next.js boileplate, adds all dependencies
- https://github.com/refinedev/refine -> boilerplate code generator

# Languages
- JS
- Typescript

# Next.js
- Next auth
- Next internationalization
- Next app router
- Alternative: after.js

# Drills
- D1 -> Making layouts -> Get a list of layout patterns from ChatGPT and implement them using grid/flexbox
- D2 -> Absolute positioning -> Grab a bunch of elements and position them in crazy places
- D3 -> Hooks + custom hooks. Come up with ways to use hooks in all ways and then extract this logic into custom hooks
- D4 -> Context. Learn to implement contexts and pass data around using them
- D4 -> Redux -> Practice using redux and mapping state and dispatch to props
- D5 -> Layering -> Read a few articles/projects about layering and do 3 projects with layers
- D6 -> Animations -> Start with basic and move on to more advanced animations
- D7 -> Project generators -> Try out a few and check that you get a project with all dependencies configured
- D8 -> Responsive design -> Create a few designs which are effortlessly responsive
- D9 -> Using libraries. Integrate about 20 different libraries and try to use them
