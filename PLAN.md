# Summary
This is the summary of all key and critical aspects of FE dev

## HTML breakdown
HTML = Collection of nested tags with attributes ~ 20% of tags are used 80% of the time

## JS breakdown
JS = Core JS(X) + Libs
JS = Core JS + React JSX
Key libs = CSS-IN-JS + Hooks + State management + HTTP
Automated tests

## CSS breakdown
CSS = Base(Static) + Responsive + Advanced(Dynamic)
Base = Layouts + Colors + Typography + Spacing
Advanced = Transitions + Animations
Design system

## Key concerns
### Developer experience
- Which tools to you ? How to use them best ?

### Dependencies
- Choosing and importing the right dependencies
- Updating dependencies -> vulnerabilities, bug fixes and improvements
- Preventing dependency conflicts

### Layouts
- Getting the layouts right and making them consistent
- Making the layouts responsive

### Styling
#### Consistency
- Across browsers -> normalize.css
- Colors
- Typography
- Layouts and spacing

### Business logic
- How to structure the code ?
- What should the folder structure be in the project ?

### API interactions
- How to keep the code clean
- How to keep the code performant

### Build and deploy
- Choosing a rendering strategy: SSG vs SSR vs CSR
- Creating and deploying a production build

### Etc
- Storybook -> design system
- SEO

# Learning Process
## Questions

### Consistency/Reusability
- How to ensure consistent gaps everywhere?
- How do I design reusable components ? Think buttons with rounded corners ? How to avoid prop overload ?

### Features
- What are the key aspects/features of next.js ?
- How can I leverage bootstrap and other UI libs as much as possible ? How do I make them customizable ?

### Layouts 
- How create high quality and clean high level layouts ?
- How do I master creating layouts 
- What are common layout pattrens ? How can I easily implement them ?

### Clean code & clean architecture
- Which patterns and best practices can I use ?
- How can I structure my app in layers ? Do I use classes or functions ?
- How can I structure my FE into modules ?
- Best practice around next.js 13 project structure ?

## Drills
- D1 -> Making layouts -> Get a list of layout patterns from ChatGPT and implement them using grid/flexbox
- D2 -> Absolute positioning -> Grab a bunch of elements and position them in crazy places
- D3 -> Hooks + custom hooks. Come up with ways to use hooks in all ways and then extract this logic into custom hooks
- D4 -> Context. Learn to implement contexts and pass data around using them
- D4 -> Redux -> Practice using redux and mapping state and dispatch to props
- D5 -> Layering -> Read a few articles/projects about layering and do 3 projects with layers
- D6 -> Animations -> Start with basic and move on to more advanced animations
- D7 -> Project generators -> Try out a few and check that you get a project with all dependencies configured
- D8 -> Responsive design -> Create a few designs which are effortlessly responsive
- D9 -> Using libraries. Integrate about 20 different libraries and try to use them
- D10 -> Component communications practice. Prop drilling, context, zustand
